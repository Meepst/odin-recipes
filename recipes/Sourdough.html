    <p>A classic, rustic sourdough recipe to satisfy all of your crispy cravings!</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (227g) ripe (fed) sourdough starter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (340g) water, lukewarm</li>
        <li>1 to 2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons (15g) salt</li>
        <li>5 cups (600g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Weigh your flour, gently spooning it into a cup to avoid clumping, sweep off an excess. And then combine all listed ingredients into a medium sized bowl,
        kneading till the mixture creates a smooth, workable dough.
      </li> 
      <li>Allow the dough to rise in a lightly greased and covered bowl until it is about double its original size, this usually takes around 90 minutes.</li>
      <li>Now that some time has past, take the now risen dough out of the bowl and begin gently dividing the dough in half, it will deflate a little do not worry, begin shaping
        each piece of dough by pulling the edges into the center and turning it over until the seam is on the bottom, continue rolling under cupped hands till dough has formed a ball.
        Now let the dough ball rest covered by a damp towel for a around 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>To make fat oval loaves, elongate each ball of dough you've preshaped by gently rolling it back and forth on an 
        unfloured work surface several times. For longer loaves, continue rolling until they're about 10" to 11" long.  </li>
      <li>Place the loaves on a light greased pan or a parchment-lined baking sheet. COver and let rise until very puffy, about 1 hour. Towards the end of the rising time, prehead the oven to 425*F.</li>
      <li>Spray the loaves with lukewarm water and dust generously with flour.</li>
      <li>Make two fairly deep diagonal slashes in each; a serrated bread knige wielded firmly works well here.</li>
      <li>Bake the bread for 25 to 30 minutes, until it's a very deep golden brown. remove it from the oven, and cool on a rack.</li> 
    </ol>
